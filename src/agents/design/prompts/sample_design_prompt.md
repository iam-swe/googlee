Create a high-quality social media image for a home bakery brand.

Subject and scene:
- Showcase freshly baked pastries placed on a rustic wooden table.
- Include a mix of items such as croissants, cupcakes, and cookies to convey variety.
- Add subtle props like baking parchment, a wooden rolling pin, and scattered flour for authenticity.
- The setting should feel warm, cozy, and homemade rather than commercial.

Composition and layout:
- Use a square composition suitable for Instagram.
- Center the baked goods as the main focal point.
- Leave clear negative space in the upper or side area for text overlay.
- Maintain visual balance without overcrowding the frame.

Lighting and mood:
- Use soft, natural lighting similar to morning sunlight from a window.
- Create warm tones that enhance golden browns and pastel frosting colors.
- Avoid harsh shadows or overly dramatic lighting.

Color and style:
- Use a warm, inviting color palette with neutral browns, creams, and soft pastels.
- Keep the style clean and modern while retaining a handmade, artisanal feel.
- Avoid overly saturated or artificial colors.

Text and branding:
- Include the text “Freshly Baked at Home” in an elegant, friendly script or rounded sans-serif font.
- Ensure the text is clearly readable and well integrated into the image.
- Do not include logos unless they are implied by the composition.

Overall intent:
- The image should communicate warmth, freshness, and trust.
- It should feel personal, welcoming, and suitable for a small home-run bakery promoting products on social media.
