Apply the following noticeable changes to the existing image:

Text changes:
- Remove the text “Freshly Baked at Home” completely from the image.
- Replace it with the text “Weekend Special” placed prominently in the available negative space.
- Use a bold, friendly sans-serif style that is clearly readable at a glance.
- Make the new text stand out strongly against the background.

Content changes:
- Remove the cupcakes from the scene entirely.
- Keep only croissants and cookies as the featured baked items.
- Rebalance the arrangement so the remaining items feel intentional and visually appealing, not sparse.

Visual emphasis:
- Make the croissants the primary focal point by slightly increasing their brightness and contrast.
- Ensure the cookies remain visible but secondary.

Style constraints:
- Preserve the rustic wooden table, props, and warm home-bakery aesthetic.
- Do not add new props or decorative elements.
- Do not change the overall framing or camera angle.

Overall goal:
- The edit should be immediately noticeable compared to the previous version.
- It should clearly communicate a different message while keeping the same scene and style.
